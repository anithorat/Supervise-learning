Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labeled data[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][4][^4^][5]. In this context, labeled data means that the input data is already tagged with the correct output[^1^][1][^2^][2][^3^][4][^4^][5].

In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machine works as the supervisor that teaches the machine to predict the output correctly[^2^][2]. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable (x) with the output variable (y)[^2^][2].

## How Supervised Learning Works?

In supervised learning, models are trained using a labeled dataset, where the model learns about each type of data[^2^][2]. Once the training process is completed, the model is tested on the basis of test data (a subset of the training set), and then it predicts the output[^2^][2].

## Applications of Supervised Learning

Supervised learning can be used for various real-world applications such as Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc[^2^][2].

## Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms

Supervised learning algorithms can be broadly divided into two types of problems:

1. **Classification**: When the output variable is a category, such as "red" or "blue", "disease" and "no disease".
2. **Regression**: When the output variable is a real value, such as "dollars" or "weight".

Some popular examples of supervised machine learning algorithms are Linear Regression for regression problems, and Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes Classifier for classification problems.
